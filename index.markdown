<a href="http://ecai2020.eu/"><img src="./ecai.jpg" height="90" alt="ECAI 2020" style="border: 3px solid #ccc; padding: 0 15px; margin: 0 5px; float: right;"></a> The development of effective techniques for knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) is a crucial aspect of successful intelligent systems.
 Different representation paradigms, as well as their use in dedicated reasoning systems, have been extensively studied in the past. Nevertheless, new challenges, problems, and issues have emerged in the context of knowledge representation in Artificial Intelligence (AI), involving the logical manipulation of increasingly large information sets (see for example Semantic Web, BioInformatics and so on). Improvements in storage capacity and performance of computing infrastructure have also affected the nature of KRR systems, shifting their focus towards representational power and execution performance. Therefore, KRR research is faced with a challenge of developing knowledge representation structures optimized for large scale reasoning. This new generation of KRR systems includes graph-based knowledge representation formalisms such as Bayesian Networks (BNs), Semantic Networks (SNs), Conceptual Graphs (CGs), Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), CP-nets, GAI-nets, Argumentation Frameworks all of which have been successfully used in a number of applications. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the researchers involved in the development and application of graph-based knowledge representation formalisms and reasoning techniques.  



Submission {#submission}
-----------------------

Subission deadline: **16 March 2020** <br/>
Notification date: **13 April 2020**
Please submit your papers **using the EasyChair system** [here](https://www.easychair.org/)

Note that the paper format must respect the ECAI paper format and must be no longer than 8 pages in length. Reviewing will NOT be double blind

The workshop proceedings will be printed and distributed during the workshop. The authors are be responsible for producing camera-ready copies of their papers, conforming to the ECAI 2020 formatting guidelines, for inclusion in the proceedings. Note that at least one author of each accepted paper/poster is required to register and attend the workshop in order to present the paper.

The accepted papers will be published in a Springer LNAI series post proceedings available. The deadline for Post Proceedings submission is around September 2020 with a planned publication date in December 2020.


Topics {#topics}
--------

The workshop welcomes contributions that **address graph-based representation and reasoning** paradigms from a theoretical, algorithmic and application viewpoint. The formalisms of interest include but are not limited to:

* Graph structures for machine learning
* Graph structures for preference modelling (CP-Nets, GAI-Nets)
* Graphs structures in argumentation
* Graphs for the Semantic Web (Property Graphs, Knowledge Graphs, etc.)
* Formal Concept Analysis
* Existential Graphs and Conceptual Graphs
* Euler Diagrams


Proceedings {#proceedings}
-------------

As with previous editions, Post-Proceedings of the workshop will be published in a special issue of the SPRINGER LNAI Series. Check the previous GKR Springer Post Proceedings [here](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~Ley/db/conf/gkr/index.html).
